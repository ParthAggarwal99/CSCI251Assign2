/**
 * HIT POINTS:
 *      Standardized across all ships for easier recognition for how much of
 *      an impact weight and armor are having.
 *      TO CONSIDER:
 *          each part having their own amount of hitpoints so individual pieces can be repaired
 *
 * ARMOR:
 *      Armor provides a flat % damage resist based on an exponential curve
 *      Curve formula f(x) = 100 / (100+.4x)
 *
 * WEIGHT:
 *      Weight determines manuvourability and fuel cost for jumps
 *      is in Tonnes
 *
 * Cargo:
 *      dictates amount of cargo available to be held
 *      each point of cargo held adds 1 tonne to weight
 *
 *
 * People:
 *      dictates crew limit, not including officers
 *
 * FUEL & FOOD:
 *      takes cargo capacity and dwindles as the space journey continues
 *      Fuel shall diminish at different amount per sector traveled to indicated varied distances between sectors
 *      Food shall diminish at at 1 tonne per amount of sectors traveled determined by amount of crew.
